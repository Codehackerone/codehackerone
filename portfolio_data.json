    "name": "Soumyajit Datta",
    "role": "CS PhD Student",
    "description": "I am a first-year PhD student and Graduate Research Assistant at Rochester Institute of Technology, specializing in Computational Linguistics and Computational Social Science. My research revolves around leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision techniques to extract valuable social insights. Additionally, I work with generative AI, with a strong focus on AI for social good and ensuring the safety of large language models (LLMs). Outside of research, I enjoy playing chess and the piano, always seeking new intellectual and creative challenges. Occasionally, I write blogs, compete on Kaggle, or dive into discovering fascinating facts about the universe.",
